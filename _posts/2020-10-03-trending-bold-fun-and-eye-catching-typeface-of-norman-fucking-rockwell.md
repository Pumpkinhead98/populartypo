[Comic book style](https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/lana-del-rey-norman-fucking-rockwell) typeface is brought back to fashion by the latest Lana Del Ray album *"Norman Fucking Rockwell".* 

"*Norman Fucking Rockwell»* newest Lana Del Ray album brings a sense of longing and nostalgia to America that could have been by referencing iconic events, and figures in popular culture. 

**[Biff Bam Boom Outline](https://fontmeme.com/norman-fucking-rockwell-font/)** font chosen for the album`s cover is similar to the typefaces typically used in comic books, which adheres to albums theme of pop culture. The idea of a comic book is strengthened further by the imagery surrounding the title. A red and orange spiky speech bubble, which reminds of a speech or action bubbles used in graphic novels, appears to call for audience attention and helps to draw attention to title written in sans-serif, bold font with same-height letters. In addition, the shadowing around the letters creates an almost 3D visual which makes the title to stand out among the light beige colour of the background. 

Moreover, the comic-style typography used in the album cover has a sense of playfulness about it and makes the title to appear more dynamic.
