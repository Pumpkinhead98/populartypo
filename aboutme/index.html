<!-- // Facts // -->
<div class="facts">

	<h1> Who am I? </h1>
  <p>I`m Ugne Matuliauskaite. I was born in Lithuania but when I was 16-17 my family and I moved to Norway. I`m now living in Oxford and am a 2nd year Media, Journalism and Publishing student at Oxford Brookes. </p>

<h1> What are my interests? </h1>
	<p>I have very varied interests and usually it`s hard for me to stick with one thing, so I`ve tried lots  of hobbies like photography, dancing, drama etc before. I think part of the reason why I keep finding new free time activities is because I like challenging myself to try new things, and also even if I don`t continue on with the activity there`s always plenty of fun memories to remember. Like this time when me and some friends took a paddle boat &#128675;:

<!-- Book List -->
<p> <span class="highlight"> Reading </span> &#128214; is one of my favourite past time activities besides watching movies. Here are some of the books I`ve read recently and recommend:</p>

</ul>


  <p class="facts"><span class="highlight"> Hiking </span> &#129406; is most recent hobbies since moving to Norway. It`s something I greatly enjoy doing with both my family and alone. Also it`s a perfect chance to take some lovely pictures!

  </p>


	<p class="facts"><span class="highlight"> Baking </span> &#129473; There`s something really therapeutic about it for me, and usually when I`m stressed or in a bad mood some sweet muffins or banana bread always help to improve my mood.

  <h1> Creative Portfolio </h1>
	<p>Since the begining of lockdown I wanted to create some sort of platform for me to build my creative portfolio. This autumn I finally got around to finally doing it and made a bookstagram <a class="fact_link" href=" https://www.instagram.com/ugnesbookshelf/" target="_top">@ugnesbookshelf</a> for book reviews,recommendations and just all kinds of bookish content.
</p>

	<p> I`ve also started a blog,Trendy Fonts to express my varied interests in books, movies/TV shows, music and fashion in form of looking how typography is used in popular culture. I had a lot of fun creating this blog and I hope people enjoy reading it too!
